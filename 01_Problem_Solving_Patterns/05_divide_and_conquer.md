# Divide and Conquer Pattern

### Time Complexity Log(N) Binary Search - O(log N)

### Space Complexity O(1)

This pattern involces diving a data set into smaller chucks and then repeating the process with a subset of the data which can tremendously decream the time complexity.

Examples of divide and conquer algorithms:

- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Binary Search
- Binary Search Trees

Most commonly used for sorting a REALLY large list of data.
