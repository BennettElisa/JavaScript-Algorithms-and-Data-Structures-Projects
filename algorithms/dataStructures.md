## Data Structures

* A way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively
* Essential ingrediantes in creating fast and powerful algorithms
* Helps manage and organize data
* Makes code cleaner and easier to understand

__Abstract Data Type__ 

    Abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which only provides the interface to which the data structure then must adhere to. The interface does not give any specific details about how or in what language it will happen. 

    | Abstraction | Inplementation |
    | ----        | ----           |
    | List        | Dynamic Array  |
    |             | Linked List    |

__Big-O Notation__

Tells us about the worst case senario. 
n - The size of the input Complexities ordered in the smallest to largest.

- Constant Time: 0(1)
    - while loop
    - for loop 
    - Linear Search 
- Logarithmic Time: 0(log(n))
    - Binary Seach
- Linear Time: 0(n)
- Linearithmic Time: 0(nlog(n))
- Quadric Time: O(n2) 
    - Double for loop 
- Cubic Time: O(n3)
- Exponential Time: O(bn)
- Facortial Time: O(n!)
