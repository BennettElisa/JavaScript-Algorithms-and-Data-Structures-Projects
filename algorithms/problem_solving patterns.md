# Problem Solving Patterns

- Frequency Counter

- Multiple Pointers

  - Creates pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards that beginning or middle based on a certain condition
  - very efficient
  - minimal space complexity
  - does this work best on **sorted** arrays
  - examples sumZero
  - countUniqueValues
    - write a function that accepts a **sorted** array of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values of that sum or zero or undefined if a pair does not exist.
    - Time Complexity O(n) using multiple pointers
    -

- Sliding Window Pattern
- Divide and Conquer Pattern
