# Mini-Learning-Blog

As I continue to strengthen my Software & Data Engineering skills I've decided to keep a record of things I'm learning along the way. Right now, I'm enrolled in a Data Structures and Algorithms course and I'm also a Data Science Fellow with Correlation One. I want to keep track of my progression through the course and have a uniformed way of taking notes. In addition, I want to share different aspects of what I'm learning in one place.

This repo will include:

* Machine Learning Algorithms
  * k-means clustering
  * KNN clustering 
* Natural Language Processing 
* JavaScript Code
  * JavaScript algorithms 
* Python Code w/ libraries such as - 
  * pandas
  * madplotlibs
  * seaborn
* And...more!

Thanks for checking me out!
