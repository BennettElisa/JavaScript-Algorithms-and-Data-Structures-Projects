# JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Projects

As I continue to strengthen my Software Engineering skills I've decided to keep a record of things I'm learning along the way. Right now, I'm enrolled in a Data Structures and Algorithms course. I want to keep track of my progression through the course and have a uniformed way of taking notes. This repo will include notes on different algorithms such as time complexity, space complexity, some code, observations etc. 

Thanks for checking me out!
