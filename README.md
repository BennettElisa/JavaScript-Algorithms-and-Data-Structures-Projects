# Mini-Learning-Blog

As I continue to strengthen my Software & Data Engineering skills I've decided to keep a record of things I'm learning along the way. Right now, I'm enrolled in a [Data Structures and Algorithms Masterclass taught by Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) and I'm also a Data Science Fellow. I want to keep track of my progression through both courses and have a uniformed way of taking notes. In addition, I want to share different aspects of what I'm learning in one place.

This repo will include:

- Machine Learning Algorithms
  - k-means clustering
  - KNN clustering
- Natural Language Processing
- JavaScript Code
  - JavaScript algorithms and data structures
- Python Code w/ libraries such as -
  - pandas
  - madplotlibs
  - seaborn
- And...more!

Thanks for checking me out!
