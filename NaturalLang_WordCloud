Using the Natural Language Tool kit on our dataset of 1M apps from Google Play and Apple App Store I created a __world cloud__ to display the __top 20__ words used in the naming conventions of eduacational apps. Here is a snippit of the code:

# Libraries for Word Cloud
from os import path
from PIL import Image
from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS, ImageColorGenerator

text = " ".join(word for word in edu_apps_df.app_name)
print('There are {} words in the app_names column'.format(len(text)))

edu_stopwords = set(STOPWORDS)
wordcloud = WordCloud(stopwords=edu_stopwords, max_words=100, background_color='lightblue').generate(text)

#display
plt.figure( figsize=(20,10) )
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
