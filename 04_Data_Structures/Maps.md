## Maps Data Structure ES6

A **map** (noun) is a data structure in JavaScript that was introduced in ES6 to associate data with keys and a proper way to handle this kind of data organization within using plan objects what will also contain the Object.prototype which now can be avoided.

JavaScript came up with a class (and data structure) called **Map** that stores a mapping and allows any type of keys i.e strings, objects, etc.

Setting properties on the Map data structure can be done individually such as:

It can also be done when initalizing Map:

```
const m = new Map([['color', 'pink'], ['owner', 'Elisa'], ['age', 28]])

```

Here is a great resource for more insight into the class Map: [link](https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-data-structures-map/)

Also **page 104** in **Eloquent JavaScript** also explains it briefly
